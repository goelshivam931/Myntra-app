• Developed a responsive Myntra web app clone using React, Redux Toolkit, and React Router, replicating
core product listing and navigation functionality to add the items in cart.

• Utilized Bootstrap, React Icons, and modern UI components to design a clean, visually appealing interface.

• Integrated a custom-built Node.js API to fetch item data, with loading spinners and state management to enhance
performance during async operations.
